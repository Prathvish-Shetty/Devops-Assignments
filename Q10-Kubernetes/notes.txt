10. Develop an application to automate the process of running containerized application 
using Kubernetes 

deployment.yaml: Tells Kubernetes how to run and manage your application's containers (number of copies, updates, rollbacks). It ensures your app stays running as desired.

service.yaml: Provides a stable network address to access your running application containers. It makes your app reachable within and potentially outside the Kubernetes cluster, without needing to know individual container IPs.

chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
kubectl get pods
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get services
kubectl delete service auto-app-service
